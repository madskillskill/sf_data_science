## Preface
I've started to use VS Code and Github while learning to code in Python. This little game shows how proficient I'm at it.
## Problem
The idea behind the **Guessing game** is to make the machine first make up and then guess a random number between 1 and 100.
## How it works?
There are two functions:
* **random_predict** makes up a number and blindly guesses it until winning, returns a number of guesses;
* **guess_game** creates a randomized array of 1000 numbers then *random_predict*s them, returns the average number of results.
