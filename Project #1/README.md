## Preface
I've started to use VS Code and Github while learning to code in Python. This little game shows how proficient I'm at it.
## Problem
The idea behind the **Guessing game** is to make the machine first make up and then guess a random number between 1 and 100.
## How it worksThere are two functions:
* **random_predict** makes up a number and blindly guesses it until winning, returns a number of guesses;
* **guess_game** creates a randomized array of 1000 numbers then *random_predict*s them, returning the average number of results.
## Files
* [**game.py**](https://github.com/madskillskill/sf_data_science/blob/main/Project%20%231/game.py) is a prototype built for one round of game for a human user;
* [**game_v2.py**](https://github.com/madskillskill/sf_data_science/blob/main/Project%20%231/game_v2.py) is a final product that makes the program play this game itself 1000 times;
* [**game.ipynb**](https://github.com/madskillskill/sf_data_science/blob/main/Project%20%231/game.ipynb) is a presentation-ready showcase of a working code (note: it references respective files in the repository);
* [**readme.md**](https://github.com/madskillskill/sf_data_science/blob/main/Project%20%231/readme.md) is the very thing you are reading rn.
## Results
It was actually funny to build this game and make it play with itself, using new tools. Git tech looks very useful not only for the code, but also for my writing works â€“ these usually end up scattered around many devices and platform in many versions. Also, Jupyter looks neat.
